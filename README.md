flume-taildirectory-source
===========================
Source of Flume NG for tailing files in a directory

Notes
=====
This plugin is based on jinoos (jinoos@gmail.com) https://github.com/jinoos/flume-ng-extends  
Is refactored to support logs rotate in windows and linux, and the code has been cleaned to much more simple working, and apache.common.vfs2 dependency has been replaced with the native java 7 java.nio library.
